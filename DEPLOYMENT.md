# Deployment Guide for Wise Paper Frontend

## Issues Fixed

1. **Search Page Authentication**: Removed PrivateRoute wrapper from Search page to allow public access
2. **Routing Issues**: Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better production compatibility
3. **Component Errors**: Fixed undefined variables and incomplete logic in Search component
4. **Build Configuration**: Updated Vite config for production builds

## Deployment Steps

1. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. **Deploy the `dist` folder** to your hosting platform

## Troubleshooting

### If Search page still doesn't work:

1. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
2. **Verify routing** - URLs should now use hash (#) format (e.g., `/#/search`)
3. **Check authentication state** - Search page should be accessible without login
4. **Verify backend API** is accessible at `https://wise-paper-backend.onrender.com`

### Common Issues:

- **CORS errors**: Backend needs to allow requests from your frontend domain
- **API endpoint issues**: Verify backend is running and accessible
- **Build errors**: Check for any TypeScript/ESLint errors before building

## File Changes Made

- `App.jsx`: Changed to HashRouter and removed PrivateRoute from Search
- `Search.jsx`: Fixed undefined variables and improved error handling
- `Home.jsx`: Updated navigation to allow direct access to Search
- `vite.config.js`: Added production build configuration
- `package.json`: Reordered scripts for better organization

## Testing

After deployment, test these navigation paths:
1. Home page → "Search Papers" button
2. Navbar → "Search Papers" link
3. Direct URL access to `/#/search`
